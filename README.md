## Introduction

  Zomato is a leading online food delivery service, providing a platform for ordering food conveniently and efficiently. In today’s day and age, the efficiency and effectiveness of food delivery services can be significantly enhanced through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio project delves into the core functionalities of Zomato’s diverse services, applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired from the course Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS). By using advanced algorithmic techniques and data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business applications. From optimizing order allocation algorithms for improved efficiency and speed to enhancing route planning for better accuracy and reduced delivery time, the potential for enhancement is vast.

This portfolio showcases how algorithms can be applied within Zomato’s ecosystem. Each use case illustrates how specific DSA principles can solve practical challenges faced by a food delivery service like Zomato, bridging the gap between theory and application. Explore the use cases to see how DSA and Algorithmic Problem Solving techniques are used to enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency in a real-world context.

## Need of Portfolio

The ever-evolving landscape of food delivery services necessitates continual improvements in service management and user experience. Zomato, as a leading player in this industry, faces various operational challenges that can be addressed through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio is essential for several reasons. Firstly, optimizing service efficiency is crucial; efficient order allocation and route planning can minimize delivery times and maximize resource utilization. By exploring advanced algorithmic solutions, this portfolio aims to enhance these processes, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient service. Additionally, the transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application is a critical step in the learning process. This portfolio provides an opportunity to apply concepts learned in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) courses to real-world problems, thereby solidifying understanding and skills.

## Data Structures and Algorithms applicable

## 1. Route Planning

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a shortest path algorithm that can be used to find the fastest way to get from one location to another. Zomato could utilize this algorithm to determine the quickest route for delivering food to customers, especially in scenarios where route costs may include negative weights, such as discounts or varying traffic conditions that affect travel time. The primary advantage of Bellman-Ford is its ability to find the shortest path even in graphs with negative edge weights, providing flexibility in route optimization under diverse conditions. However, a significant disadvantage is that it is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for graphs without negative edge weights, making it less efficient in those cases. The worst-case time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), where V is the number of restaurants and E is the number of connections between them, indicating that it can be computationally intensive for large graphs. Despite this, its versatility in handling negative weights makes it a valuable tool for comprehensive route planning in varied delivery environments.

## 2. Restaurant Recommendations

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that can be used to find all the restaurants within a certain distance from a customer's location. Zomato could utilize BFS to recommend nearby restaurants to customers based on their location, enhancing user experience by providing relevant and convenient dining options. The primary advantage of BFS is its simplicity, making it easier to implement compared to Depth-First Search (DFS). Additionally, BFS ensures that the closest restaurants are found first, providing users with the nearest options. However, BFS can consume more memory than DFS for certain graphs, especially those with high branching factors. Despite this, its efficiency in finding nearby locations quickly makes it an ideal choice for generating location-based restaurant recommendations. The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of restaurants and E is the number of connections between them, making it efficient for large networks.

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that Zomato could employ to discover restaurants connected to a particular establishment, aiding in recommending similar dining options to customers. Unlike Breadth-First Search (BFS), DFS explores deeply into each restaurant network before backtracking, which can be more memory-efficient for certain types of connections. However, implementing DFS requires handling recursion or managing a stack, making it more complex than BFS. In terms of efficiency, DFS operates in O(V + E) time complexity, where V is the number of restaurants and E is the number of connections between them, making it a viable choice for exploring restaurant networks effectively.

## 3. Food delivery Routes optimisation

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a pivotal tool for calculating maximum flow within a network, a capability Zomato could leverage to streamline food delivery operations by optimizing driver routes. This algorithm systematically determines the maximum volume of flow that can traverse from a source to a sink in a network, ensuring efficient distribution of resources like delivery routes among restaurants and customers.While beneficial for its ability to handle complex networks with varying capacities, it's important to note that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can be computationally demanding, especially for larger networks. Its time complexity, O(E * F), where E represents the number of edges and F is the maximum flow value, underscores the need for efficient implementation to maintain performance across our expanding delivery operations.
