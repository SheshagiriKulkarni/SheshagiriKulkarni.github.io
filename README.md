## Introduction

  Zomato is a leading online food delivery service, providing a platform for ordering food conveniently and efficiently. In today’s day and age, the efficiency and effectiveness of food delivery services can be significantly enhanced through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio project delves into the core functionalities of Zomato’s diverse services, applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired from the course Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS). By using advanced algorithmic techniques and data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business applications. From optimizing order allocation algorithms for improved efficiency and speed to enhancing route planning for better accuracy and reduced delivery time, the potential for enhancement is vast.

This portfolio showcases how algorithms can be applied within Zomato’s ecosystem. Each use case illustrates how specific DSA principles can solve practical challenges faced by a food delivery service like Zomato, bridging the gap between theory and application. Explore the use cases to see how DSA and Algorithmic Problem Solving techniques are used to enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency in a real-world context.

## Need of Portfolio

The ever-evolving landscape of food delivery services necessitates continual improvements in service management and user experience. Zomato, as a leading player in this industry, faces various operational challenges that can be addressed through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio is essential for several reasons. Firstly, optimizing service efficiency is crucial; efficient order allocation and route planning can minimize delivery times and maximize resource utilization. By exploring advanced algorithmic solutions, this portfolio aims to enhance these processes, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient service. Additionally, the transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application is a critical step in the learning process. This portfolio provides an opportunity to apply concepts learned in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) courses to real-world problems, thereby solidifying understanding and skills.
